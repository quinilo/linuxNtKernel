LinuxNtKernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

# FAQ

Does it work on all platforms?

    Define "work."

Is this compatible with NTFS?

    Oh, absolutely! LinuxNtKernel loves NTFS... so much that it refuses to mount it out of pure emotional attachment. (Weâ€™re working on it.)

Will it improve my system's performance?

    That depends. Do you consider frequent kernel panics to be a form of "improvement"?

Can I use this in production?

    Technically, yes. But only if you hate your users.
